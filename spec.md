# MVP - Minimum requirements
1. Account creation/closure
2. Transfers
3. Persistent SQL backend
4. reccurring transfers
5. Proxy accounts
6. Administrative account.


# Stuff that'll probably be needed before deployment
1. Citizenship:
	- Accounts will need to be "owned" by a discord server to ensure correct taxation etc.
	- Admin accounts will also need to be restricted to operate only within their "country"
2. Wealth tax:
	- Was a feature of taubot V1 not sure if it'll be wanted again.
3. Income tax:
	- Was not a feature of taubot V1 but was heavily requested, will need to categorise types of recurring transfers tho.
4. Account Classes:
	- Bit like the old auth levels stuff just for corpo and gov proxy accounts - they were a retrofit in taubot V1 would rather they were defined within the codebase




# Stuff I'd like to do but can wait till after release if needs be
1. API - allow people to write bots that interface with their account
