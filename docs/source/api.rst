API
===

Taubot exposes a HTTPS API available at https://qwrky.dev/api/
All data unless otherwise specified should be sent using json encoding.


Authentication
--------------

DM SoTec Stoner to get a master application key and it's associated application id.


Types of keys:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Master Key
     - Grant Key
   * - Master keys are issued to applications, if requested they can be granted certain taubot permissions, but are notable for their ability to create GRANT keys
     - Grant Keys are issued by a user to an application, it allows them to grant a subset of their taubot permissions to an application


The key being used to make a request should be set as the :code:`authorization` HTTP header.





Oauth-like flow overview
------------------------

(name suggestions are greatly appreciated)

This section pretains to the distribution of Grant Keys to applications.


The flow is as follows:
  
  1. Application initiates proccess py posting a UUID identifier to :code:`/api/oauth-references`, and sends the user a link containing the UUID in a query string along with their application id
  
  2. User clicks link and sets the grant scopes they wish to grant the API

  3. User returns to application and confirms that they've completed the grant process

  4. Application gets :code:`/api/retrieve-key/{reference_id}` where reference id is the id they set in their post request, 


Starting the oauth-like flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As mentioned above the application should send a post request to :code:`/api/oauth-references` 
containing a UUID used to identify this particular flow.

This UUID should be sent in the POST body json encoded with the key :code:`ref_id`.

Afterwards a url should be sent to the User granting the application permissions, this same referencce id should be included in the querystring labelled :code:`ref_id`. the application id should also be sent in the querystring and labelled aid


*Example Python Code using requests*

.. code-block:: python

   import requests
   from uuid import UUID

   # for obvious reasons these should be loaded from a config rather than hardcoded
   master_key: str = "master key goes here"
   application_id: UUID = UUID("application id goes here")

   def get_auth_link(ref_id: UUID) -> str:
       resp = requests.post(
            "https://qwrky.dev/api/oauth-references",
            data={"ref_id": str(ref_id)},
            headers={"Authorization": master_key}
       )
       resp.raise_for_status()

       # since uuids are urlsafe this is fine
       return f"https://qwrky.dev/api/oauth/grant?ref={str(ref_id)}&aid={str(application_id)}"


Once the user has completed the grant process they should inform the application somehow and the application can then retrieve their token


Retrieving a token
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that the user has confirmed with the application the token has been isued and it's time for the application to retrieve it's token

This should be done by sending a get request to :code:`/api/retrieve-key/{ref_id}` where :code:`ref_id` is the same UUID used to initiate the claim process. 

The response will be json data with the new auth key set as the :code:`key` attribute.

This key will have the same permissions the user set.

*Example Python code using requests*

.. code-block:: python

   import requests
   from uuid import UUID

   # for obvious reasons these should be loaded from a config rather than hardcoded
   master_key: str = "master key goes here"
   application_id: UUID = UUID("application id goes here")

   def retrieve_key(ref_id: UUID) -> str:
      # since UUIDs are urlsafe this is fine
      resp = requests.get(
           f"https://qwrky.dev/api/retrieve-key/{str(ref_id)}",
           headers = {}
      )
      resp.raise_for_status()

      return resp.json()["key"]


This token should be persisted somewhere, and used to make requests on behalf of the issuer
